## Setup

* Install [node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm]() and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
* Run `yarn` in this directory

## Local development

You need two terminal sessions for this.

* Run `yarn d`
* Run `PORT=<your port number> node serve.js`
* Navigate to `localhost:<port number>` to see the results
* Refresh the page when changes are made to see the updates

Feeling the indentation is ugly or there are too many messy lines? Run `yarn lint` regularly and it will prettify the code for you.
